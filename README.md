# health-effects-of-air-pollution
1.1  Introduction Business Context. Air pollution is a very serious issue that the global population is currently dealing with. The abundance of air pollutants is not only contributing to global warming, but it is also causing problematic health issues to the population. There have been numerous efforts to protect and improve air quality across most nations. However, it seems that we are making very little progress. One of the main causes of this is the fact that the majority of air pollutants are derived from the burning of fossil fuels such as coal. Big industries and several other economical and political factors have slowed the progress towards the use of renewable energy by promoting the use of fossil fuels. Nevertheless, if we educate the general population and create awareness of this issue, we will be able to overcome this problem in the future.
